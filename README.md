# Email-Spam_detection_NLP
The project involves building a machine learning model that can accurately identify spam emails. This is done by collecting a large dataset of labeled emails, preprocessing the data, extracting relevant features, selecting and training a machine learning algorithm, evaluating the performance of the model, and deploying it in a production environment.
